## 🌱 What is this session about?

Most people hear **Git** and **GitHub** and think:

> “This is scary.” 😨
> “I’ll learn it later.” 🫠
> “I’ll just download ZIP.” 💀

We’re here to **break that fear**.

This session is about:

* Understanding **what Git actually does**
* Knowing **why GitHub exists**
* Playing with Git in a **fun, chill, hands-on way**
* Making your **first commits without stress**

No prior experience needed. Curiosity is enough 🔥

---

## 🤔 So… what is Git?

**Git** is a tool that:

* Keeps track of changes in your code
* Helps you go back in time if something breaks
* Lets multiple people work on the same project

Think of Git as:

> 🧠 “CTRL + Z for your entire project, but smarter”

---

## 🌍 What is GitHub then?

**GitHub** is:

* A place to **store Git projects online**
* Share your code with others
* Collaborate with people
* Show your work to the world

Think of GitHub as:

> ☁️ “Google Drive for code + teamwork”

## 🧪 This project

This repository contains a **simple fun website** made using:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

We use this project to:

* Initialize a Git repository
* Make changes
* Commit them
* Push to GitHub
* Break things safely 😄

---

## 🗂️ Project structure

```
getSetGit/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
└── README.md
```

Nothing fancy. Nothing scary.

---

## 🚀 Try it yourself (Step by Step)

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhi-jithb/get-set-git.git
```
---

### 2️⃣ Open the project

Just open `index.html` in your browser.

Yes. That’s it.
No server. No setup. No drama.

---

### 3️⃣ Make a small change ✨

Open `index.html` or `script.js` and:

* Change a line of text
* Add your own funny quote
* Rename the title
* Break something (allowed 😌)

Example (in `script.js`):

```js
"Git is scary until it isn't."
```

---

### 4️⃣ Check Git status

```bash
git status
```

This tells you:

> “Hey, something changed here 👀”

---

### 5️⃣ Add your changes

```bash
git add .
```

This means:

> “Yes Git, I want to save these changes”

---

### 6️⃣ Commit your changes 🧠

```bash
git commit -m "added my first fun quote"
```

A commit is like:

> 📸 “Snapshot of your project at this moment”

---

### 7️⃣ Push to GitHub 🚀

```bash
git push
```

Boom. Your code is now online 🌍

---

## 🧠 Things to remember (Very important)

* Everyone messes up with Git. Everyone.
* `git status` is your best friend.
* Googling errors is part of the process.
* You learn Git by **using it**, not by memorizing commands.

---

## 😄 Common beginner thoughts (and truths)

> “What if I break the project?”
> ✔ That’s how you learn.

> “Others are better than me.”
> ✔ Everyone started here.

> “I don’t fully understand yet.”
> ✔ Perfect. You’re doing it right.

---

## 💡 Want to explore more?

Try:

* Creating a new branch
* Editing the CSS colors
* Adding your own button
* Forking this repo and experimenting freely

No marks. No judgement. Just learning.

## 🫂 Final note

If Git feels confusing today — that’s okay.
One day you’ll casually say:

git push origin main
```

and smile 😄

Happy hacking ✨
